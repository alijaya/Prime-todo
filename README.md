# Prime powered To-Do list app

This project demonstrates the use of:
[MVC](http://prime.vc/documentation/mvc.html), [Components](http://prime.vc/api/prime-components/) styled with [CSS](http://prime.vc/documentation/CSS.html)
using [Bindable](https://github.com/touch/PrimeVC/tree/master/prime-bindable) collections to update the list.

The [Layout](http://prime.vc/documentation/layout.html) of tasks can be switched and shows how to switch [algorithms](http://prime.vc/documentation/layout_algorithms.html) at runtime.

Note that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) must be installed in order to compile this application.

#### Roadmap

1. Demonstrate the use of prime-i18n
